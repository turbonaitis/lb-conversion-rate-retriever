# What is this?
This is a small Python script that will retrieve official currecy exchange rates from the Bank of Lithuania, which you can also manually retrieve [here](https://www.lb.lt/lt/pagal-buhalterines-apskaitos-istatyma-formuojami-euro-ir-uzsienio-valiutu-santykiai).

# Running the tool
## Install dependencies
```
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Execute
The script takes the list of dates (separated by new line) in the format of `YYYY-MM-dd`. They can either be read from stdin
```
$ echo "2020-05-20
2020-03-01
2020-01-01
2018-03-22" | python main.py
```
or you can pass a file name with dates as the first argument
```
python main.py /tmp/dates
```
The script will then write exchange rates in the same order to stdout
```
1,095
1,0977
1,1234
1,2286
```
NOTE: the decimal separator used by The Bank of Lithuania is "," and I didn't bother changing it. If you need other decimal separators - just use `sed`
```
python main.py /tmp/dates | sed s/,/./
```
